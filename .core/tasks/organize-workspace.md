# Organize Workspace Task

Execute intelligent workspace reorganization based on analysis and user requirements.

## Process

### Step 1: Scope Definition

Ask user to specify reorganization scope:

1. **Full Workspace** - Complete restructure (use when >100 pages or major changes needed)
2. **Specific Project** - Reorganize single project (AIMI, My-Watch-Club, etc.)  
3. **Domain Focus** - Reorganize specific domain (Technical, Business, Product)
4. **Cross-References** - Optimize cross-agent collaboration areas
5. **Threshold-Triggered** - Address specific threshold that was reached

### Step 2: Pre-Reorganization Analysis

**Before making changes:**

1. **Backup Current State**:
   - Save current hierarchy config as backup
   - Document current page locations for rollback capability

2. **Impact Assessment**:
   - Identify which pages will be moved
   - Check for existing references that might break
   - Estimate disruption to agent workflows

3. **User Confirmation**:
   - Present detailed reorganization plan
   - Show before/after structure comparison
   - Get explicit approval before proceeding

### Step 3: Execute Reorganization

**Implementation steps:**

1. **Create New Structure**:
   - Create new folders/subdomains as needed in Notion
   - Update hierarchy config with new structure

2. **Content Migration**:
   - Move pages to optimal locations based on their tags and content
   - Update internal references and links
   - Preserve page history and metadata

3. **Update References**:
   - Update classification paths in hierarchy config
   - Refresh any reference indexes or mappings
   - Notify agents of structural changes

### Step 4: Validation & Optimization

**Post-reorganization checks:**

1. **Structure Validation**:
   - Verify all pages moved correctly
   - Check that no content was lost or broken
   - Validate new hierarchy makes logical sense

2. **Agent Workflow Testing**:
   - Test that agents can still find and reference content
   - Verify wrap tasks work with new structure
   - Confirm cross-agent references still function

3. **Performance Assessment**:
   - Measure if findability improved
   - Check if agent reference speed increased
   - Validate that reorganization met objectives

### Step 5: Documentation & Training

**Complete reorganization:**

1. **Update Documentation**:
   - Update hierarchy config with final structure
   - Document changes made and rationale
   - Update agent guidelines if needed

2. **Agent Notification**:
   - Inform all agents of structural changes
   - Provide updated reference guidelines
   - Share new optimal workflows if applicable

3. **Success Metrics**:
   - Document improvements achieved
   - Set up monitoring for future optimization needs
   - Plan next review cycle

## Safety Protocols

- **Never delete content** - Only move and reorganize
- **Preserve all references** - Maintain content accessibility
- **Rollback capability** - Always have undo plan ready
- **User approval required** - No autonomous major changes
- **Gradual implementation** - Prefer incremental over radical changes

## Output Deliverables

- **Reorganization Report**: What was changed and why
- **Updated Hierarchy Config**: New structure and thresholds
- **Agent Guidelines Update**: New workflows if needed  
- **Performance Metrics**: Before/after comparison
- **Future Recommendations**: Next optimization opportunities
