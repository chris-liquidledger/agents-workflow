# Evolve Hierarchy Task

Smart hierarchy evolution based on content growth and threshold triggers.

## Process

### Step 1: Threshold Assessment

**Check current thresholds status:**

1. **Load Current State**:
   ```bash
   cd .core/scripts && npm run hierarchy && cd ../..
   ```

2. **Analyze Triggered Thresholds**:
   - **Project Domain Expansion** (10+ pages): Which projects need domain folders?
   - **Subdomain Creation** (20+ pages in domain): Which domains need subdomains?  
   - **Cross-Reference Growth** (5+ cross-agent mentions): New collaboration categories?
   - **Workspace Reorganization** (100+ total): Major restructure needed?

3. **Priority Assessment**:
   - Which threshold triggers are most urgent?
   - What's the impact of delaying reorganization?
   - Are there dependencies between different reorganizations?

### Step 2: Evolution Strategy Design

**Design incremental evolution plan:**

1. **Minimal Disruption Approach**:
   - Identify smallest changes that address thresholds
   - Plan evolution that preserves existing agent workflows
   - Design backward-compatible structure changes

2. **Growth Projection**:
   - Estimate content growth rate per project/agent
   - Plan structure that accommodates future expansion  
   - Consider upcoming agent roles (ui-ux, marketer, etc.)

3. **Optimization Opportunities**:
   - Identify content that could be better organized
   - Suggest new Cross-References categories for collaboration
   - Recommend tag improvements for better discoverability

### Step 3: Evolution Execution

**Implement incremental changes:**

1. **Structure Expansion**:
   - Create new subdomains where thresholds triggered
   - Add new project domains for growing projects
   - Establish Cross-References categories for collaboration

2. **Content Migration**:
   - Move content to more specific locations
   - Update tags to reflect new structure
   - Preserve all existing references and URLs

3. **Config Updates**:
   - Update hierarchy-config.yaml with new structure
   - Adjust thresholds based on actual usage patterns
   - Document evolution decisions for future reference

### Step 4: Agent Workflow Integration

**Ensure agents adapt to evolved structure:**

1. **Update Agent Guidelines**:
   - Inform agents of new structure options
   - Update tagging rules for new categories
   - Provide examples of new classification paths

2. **Test Agent Integration**:
   - Verify agents can wrap content to new locations
   - Test cross-agent references still work  
   - Confirm threshold monitoring continues accurately

3. **Performance Validation**:
   - Measure if content findability improved
   - Check if agent reference speed increased
   - Validate evolution achieved intended optimization

### Step 5: Future Planning

**Prepare for continued growth:**

1. **Set New Thresholds**:
   - Adjust threshold values based on evolution results
   - Plan proactive expansion for high-growth areas
   - Consider dynamic threshold adjustment

2. **Monitor Evolution Success**:
   - Track content organization effectiveness
   - Measure agent satisfaction with new structure
   - Identify patterns for next evolution cycle

3. **Strategic Roadmap**:
   - Plan for future agent additions
   - Design structure for anticipated project types
   - Prepare for workspace scaling challenges

## Evolution Principles

- **Incremental Growth** - Expand structure gradually as needed
- **Pattern-Based** - Base evolution on actual content patterns
- **Agent-Centric** - Optimize for agent productivity and ease of use
- **Future-Aware** - Design evolution that accommodates growth
- **User-Driven** - Always get approval before structural changes
- **Evidence-Based** - Support evolution decisions with metrics

## Success Criteria

- Thresholds no longer triggered after evolution
- Agents can efficiently find and reference content
- Structure supports current workflow patterns  
- Foundation prepared for future growth
- User satisfaction with organization improvements
